# OpenAI Assistant Audio Transcription and Response

This project utilizes OpenAI's APIs to transcribe audio files and generate responses based on the transcribed text. It includes functionality to convert audio to text, send the transcribed text to OpenAI's assistant, and receive a response. Additionally, it can convert text back into audio.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or later
- OpenAI API key
- Install necessary Python libraries: `openai`, `pydub`, `ratelimit`, and any other dependencies.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install openai pydub ratelimit
   ```
3. Ensure you have an OpenAI API key and set it in your environment variables:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
   ```

## Usage

1. Place the audio file you want to transcribe in the project directory.
2. Update the `FILE_NAME` variable in the script to reflect the name of your audio file.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python generate_transcription.py
   ```

## How it Works

1. The script first transcribes the audio file into text using OpenAI's Whisper model.
2. The transcribed text is then sent to the OpenAI Assistant.
3. The Assistant processes the text and sends back a response.
4. The script can also convert the response text back into audio using OpenAI's Text-to-Speech model.

## Customization

- You can modify the `convert_audio_text` and `convert_text_audio` functions to change language settings or audio properties.
- Adjust `TIME_FOR_EACH_CHUNK` to change the duration of each audio chunk for transcription.

## Important Notes

- Ensure that the audio file is clear and free of background noise for accurate transcription.
- Keep in mind the OpenAI API usage limits and costs.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any API related errors, check your API key and internet connection.
- Audio transcription accuracy can vary based on the quality of the audio file.
